// can I restate the problem in my own words
  // implement addition
// what are the inputs that go into the problem ?
  //  - ints?
  //  - floats?
  //  - what about string for large numbers?
// what are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem?
  // - int
  // - float
  // - string
// can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
// how should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem
